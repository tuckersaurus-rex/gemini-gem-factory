Here is the structure of my Decimal Protocol Gem Artifact System.

.
├─ brains
│  └─ [00-files.md]
├─ context
│  └─ [files.*]
├─ kernel.md
├─ manifest.yaml
└─ README.md

1) The brains folder contains all our Decimal Protocol brain files.
2) The context folder contains all our non-Decimal Protocol context files.
3) kernel.md is the template file used to populate a Gem Artifact's instruction text.
4) manifest.yaml is the Gem Artifact definition file. my system is setup through GitHub GitActions and upon merging to main, it reads the manifest file and contructs each artifact folder with a zip of the brain files and a copy of all the context files. it then pushes the results into a 'releases' folder on my Google Drive for easy upload.
5) README.md contains a description of the Decimal Protocol system and how to use the manifest file to create Gem Artifacts.

I've uploaded my current manifest.yaml (only details my old Gem Artifact), deploy-to-drive.yml GitAction that builds the Gem Artifacts, and quality-check.yml GitAction that ensures it's safe to merge to main.

I need you to read my manifest.yaml, deploy-to-drive.yml, and quality-check.yml then make changes to compensate for the changes made to our Decimal Protocol system.
