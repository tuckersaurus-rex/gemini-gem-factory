# Gemini Gem Configuration

## Overview

This repository manages the source code for Gemini Gem "Knowledge Files." It utilizes a modular architecture known as the **Century Protocol**, which enforces a strict 3-digit numeric hierarchy to manage instruction priority.

## The Century Protocol Structure

- **000-099 (Core):** Kernel instructions and safety protocols.
- **100-199 (Role):** Persona definitions (e.g., Architect, Developer).
- **200-299 (Standards):** Operational standards (e.g., Module writing rules).
- **300-899 (Tech):** Hard skills and frameworks (C#, Blazor, Python).
- **900-999 (Project):** Business logic and specific project constraints.

## Usage

All files are maintained in **Kebab-Case** and intended to be uploaded directly to the "Knowledge" section of a Gemini Gem.
