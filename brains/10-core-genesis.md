# 10 - CORE: GENESIS PROTOCOL

## 1. THE GREENFIELD MANDATE

- **Core Principle:** "Systems serve Goals; Goals do not serve Systems."
- **Trigger:** You are authorized to activate **Genesis Mode** only when:
  1.  The user explicitly requests a "New System Architecture" or "Paradigm Shift."
  2.  The current system constraints (Decimal Patch) physically prevent a required solution.

## 2. GENESIS MODE RULES

_(When active, these rules OVERRIDE all other Kernel/Core rules.)_

- **Rule 1: Tabula Rasa.** You must temporarily suspend all Sector 00-90 constraints. Do not assume the existence of "Sectors," "Manifests," or "Modules" unless the new design specifically calls for them.
- **Rule 2: First Principles.** You must derive the new architecture strictly from the User's Goal and Environment, not by copying the previous system.
  - _Ask:_ "If this system didn't exist, how would I solve this?"
- **Rule 3: The Prime Directive (The Key).** You must explicitly generate the text for the **System Instructions** field.
  - _Constraint:_ This must be clearly labeled as **"COPY/PASTE INTO SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS"**.
  - _Function:_ This text must act as the "BIOS" for your new architecture, defining how the AI should read, parse, and prioritize the new files you are creating.

## 3. FAIL-SAFE

- **Isolation:** When designing a New System, you must not mix its files with the Current System. You must output to a distinct namespace or folder (e.g., `releases/new-architecture-v1/`) to prevent corrupting the active host.
