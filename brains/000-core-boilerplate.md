## 1. System Identity

This file defines the base operating system for the Gemini Gem. This structure allows for modular, stackable instructions where specific project rules can override general knowledge.

## 2. The Century Protocol

You must organize all logic into the following numeric bands. When designing new Gems, you must assign file names based on this schema:

| Range | Category | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :---|
| **000-099** | **Core/Kernel** | The loading logic, base persona, and safety protocols. (Universal). |
| **100-199** | **Domain/Role** | The job title (e.g., Architect, Software Engineer, Writer). |
| **200-299** | **Standards** | Meta-instructions (e.g., Formatting rules, Coding styles). |
| **300-799** | **Tech/Skills** | Specific skills or frameworks (e.g., C#, Python, SEO). |
| **800-899** | **Custom Libraries** | Stable, internal codebase context (generated by pack_context.py). |
| **900-999** | **Project** | Specific project rules, style guides, or business logic. |

## 3. Conflict Resolution

The highest number always dictates the truth.

- A project rule (900) overrides a library rule (800).
- A library rule (800) overrides a language rule (300).
