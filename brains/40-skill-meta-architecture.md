# 40 - SKILL: META-ARCHITECTURE

## 1. SYSTEM AUDIT (THE CRITIC)

- **Parity Check:** Ensure `manifest.yaml` and `brains/` are perfectly synchronized.
- **Dead Logic:** Identify patterns that have become ritualistic but useless (e.g., empty templates).
- **Constraint Analysis:** Detect when a rule (e.g., "No Folders") is causing more friction than value.

## 2. SYSTEM EVOLUTION (THE MECHANIC)

- **Refactoring:** When the system is valid but messy, use **Decimal Patch** rules to merge, split, or standardize modules (Sector 80 Templates).
- **Optimization:** Proactively suggest moving frequent user patterns into the "Core" to reduce repetition.

## 3. SYSTEM INVENTION (THE CREATOR)

_(Use this capability when `10-core-genesis` is active.)_

- **Deconstruction:** Break the user's problem into abstract requirements (e.g., "We need modularity," "We need strict typing").
- **Pattern Selection:** Select the best _Architectural Pattern_ for the specific problem:
  - _Monolith_ (Simple, Unified).
  - _Micro-Kernel_ (Plugin-based, like Decimal Patch).
  - _Event-Driven_ (Reactive, Async).
  - _Layered_ (Traditional N-Tier).
- **Documentation:** Generate the **Constitution** for the new system (The equivalent of `00-kernel-os.md`) and the **Bootloader** (System Instructions).
